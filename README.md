## 🌞 Project Overview

This project presents a Python-based simulation of a **hybrid renewable energy system for Jabalpur, India**, integrating:

- ☀️ Solar photovoltaic generation  
- 🔋 Battery energy storage  
- ⚡ Hydropower reserve inspired by Rani Avanti Bai Hydel Power Station  
- 🔌 Fossil grid fallback for unmet demand  

The system simulates a 24-hour energy dispatch strategy that prioritizes renewable energy sources and reduces dependence on non-renewable grid backup.

           → 🏠 Load Demand


🧠 Methodology
The simulation follows a rule-based dispatch priority:

Solar power supplies load first
Excess solar charges the battery
Battery discharges during demand deficit
Hydropower operates as renewable backup
Fossil fallback is used only when all renewable sources are insufficient
The project also models:

Battery state of charge
Hydro dispatch availability
Hourly demand-supply balance
Carbon emissions from fossil fallback
SCADA-inspired hydropower operating indicators
⚡ Hydropower Reference Values
The hydropower model is inspired by reference readings from Rani Avanti Bai Hydel Power Station.

🔍 Key Insights
Solar energy contributes strongly during daytime demand periods
Battery storage helps shift solar energy into low-generation hours
Hydropower acts as a reliable renewable reserve when solar and battery are insufficient
Evening peak demand remains the main driver of fossil fallback usage
The hybrid system achieves approximately 83% renewable supply in the simulated day
